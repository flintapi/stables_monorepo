## Getting started

### Merchant console

To begin consuming the API resources in your application, you must first create a merchant account in the [Merchant Console.](https://console.flintapi.io)

This gives you access to the API keys and other credentials required to interact with the API. The dashboard can also be used to view your transaction history, create and manage wallets, subscribe to events that occur with an address, and so much more.

### API Keys

Your keys authorize your access to the API resources and enable you to interact with the API endpoints. They must be kept secure and not shared with unauthorized parties.

<Callout type="info">
  Very easily and quickly delete compromised keys, and create new ones, in your
  merchant console
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  API Keys are only visible in the first session they're created. Copy your key
  immediately and keep it secure.
</Callout>

#### Permissions

API Keys are by default, given permission to access all resources. You have fine-grained control over what resource a key is allowed to access. All this can be managed for each key in the merchant console.

### Webhooks

Webhooks enable you to track transaction lifecycle events, and receive real-time notifications when transactions complete or fail. Webhooks can also be used to react to wallet creation, update and deletion events along with wallet operations and more.

#### Signature Verification

Webhooks are signed using your webhook secret key, which is unique to your merchant account. This ensures that the webhook is coming from the Flint stables stack API and not a malicious actor. You can find your webhook secret in the [merchant console.](https://console.flintapi.io)
