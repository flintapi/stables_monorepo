description: All API requests are required to be authorized.
---

Authorize all requests with the `x-api-key` header. Your API key can be found in the Flint [dashboard](https://console.flintapi.io).

<Callout type="warn" title="API Key Security">
  Your API key is a secret and should not be shared with anyone, or left in your
  codebase as plaintext. If you suspect your API key has been compromised,
  kindly log into your merchant console and delete said key.
</Callout>

## Sample request with authorization

```ts
async function getTransactions() {
  const request = await fetch(
    `${process.env.FLINT_API_BASE_URL}/v1/transactions`,
    {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': `${process.env.FLINT_API_KEY}`,
      },
    },
  )

  const response = await request.json()
  return response
}
```
