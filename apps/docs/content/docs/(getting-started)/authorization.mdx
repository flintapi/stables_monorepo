title: Authorization
description: All API requests are required to be authorized.

Authorize all requests with the `x-api-key` header. Your API key can be found in the Flint [dashboard](https://console.flintapi.io).

<Callout type="warn" title="API Key Security">
  Your API key is a secret and should not be shared with anyone, or left in your
  codebase as plaintext. If you suspect your API key has been compromised,
  kindly log into your merchant console and delete said key.
</Callout>

## Sample request with authorization

Authorize a request to the stables stack API using the `x-api-key` header. Alternatively, you can use the `flint-api-key` header.

```ts tab="x-api-key"
async function getTransactions() {
  const request = await fetch(
    `${process.env.FLINT_API_BASE_URL}/v1/transactions`,
    {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': `${process.env.FLINT_API_KEY}`,
      },
    },
  )

  const response = await request.json()
  return response
}
```

```ts tab="flint-api-key"
async function getTransactions() {
  const request = await fetch(
    `${process.env.FLINT_API_BASE_URL}/v1/transactions`,
    {
      headers: {
        'flint-api-key': `${process.env.FLINT_API_KEY}`,
      },
    },
  )

  const response = await request.json()
  return response
}
```

That is it! That is all that is required to hit the Flint stables stack API, access on/off ramp, manage wallets, and subscribe to blockchain events.

## Webhook signature verification

```ts
import crypto from 'node:crypto'

export function isWebhookSignatureValid(
  body: any,
  signature: string,
  webhookSecretKey: string,
): boolean {
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha512', webhookSecretKey)
    .update(JSON.stringify(body))
    .digest('hex')

  return signature === hash
}
```
